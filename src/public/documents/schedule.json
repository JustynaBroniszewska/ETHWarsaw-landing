However, the biggest bottleneck for Oracles is the high storage costs of EVM which hinder scalability. We'll present how passing data packages to transaction call data could effectively solve that issue and unlock Web3 potential 🚀 Simultaneously EVM blockchains use a monolithic architecture where recording transactions are tightly coupled with the execution layer. We’ll present an alternative approach where transaction ordering is separated from evaluation and state updates, making the architecture million times cheaper and scalable for computation & storage 💽",

The next step is being able to integrate off-chain data into smart contract automation, enabling projects to automatically trigger actions when specified real-world conditions are met. Gelato Network is Web3's premier automation network, enabling developers to automate a wide variety of arbitrary smart contract executions on and across all EVM-compatible blockchains. Examples of use cases developers have built on top of Gelato include Limit Orders on AMMs like Uniswap, automatic compounding of yield farming vaults, Aave liquidation protection, MakerDAO debt ceiling updates, automated liquidity management, and even the petting of Aavegotchis.",

For the first time in history, general users have the power to affect the brands' next step. There is “we” in web 3 for all of these reasons. I would like to dive deeper into 3 factors of community development (connectedness, co-creation, credentials), highlight the ways traditional businesses can build a community in web3 (DAOs, IRL events), and some recent examples (Lacoste, Tag Heuer, KPMG, Adidas).",
