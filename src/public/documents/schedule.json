We have only just scratched the surface of automation's potential in DeFi , from user-friendly trading strategies to infrastructure-level liquidation protection. The next step is being able to integrate off-chain data into smart contract automation, enabling projects to automatically trigger actions when specified real-world conditions are met. Gelato Network is Web3's premier automation network, enabling developers to automate a wide variety of arbitrary smart contract executions on and across all EVM-compatible blockchains. Examples of use cases developers have built on top of Gelato include Limit Orders on AMMs like Uniswap, automatic compounding of yield farming vaults, Aave liquidation protection, MakerDAO debt ceiling updates, automated liquidity management, and even the petting of Aavegotchis.",
